# GNN versus MLP

This repository will try to make an analysis/correlation between training a Reinforcement Learning algorithm (OpenAI deepQ baseline)
with a MLP as the background deep learning entity versus using some newer GNN models.

The training occurs using the Tensorflow library.

This work is extremely WIP and is in exploration phase, so there is no comment on codes nor any kind of guides to run this code.
